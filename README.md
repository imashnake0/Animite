[Animite](https://github.com/users/imashnake0/projects/1) is an unofficial client for [AniList](https://anilist.co/) (and potentially [MAL](https://myanimelist.net/)).

## Stack
The app tries to make use of the latest libraries and APIs:
- **Architecture:** [MVVM](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture).
- **Networking:** [Apollo Kotlin](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-kotlin), [Kotlin Coroutines](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines), and [COIL](https://coil-kt.github.io/coil/).
- **UI/UX:** Made purely with [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose); assets using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/).
- **Dependency Injection:** [Hilt](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-android).
- **Gradle:** [Version catalogs](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/platforms.html) and [refreshVersions](https://github.com/jmfayard/refreshVersions).

### Architecture
At the moment, the app uses [Google's choice for app architecture](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture), MVVM, since I don't know any better.
